.SH NAME
pemtrans - convert OpenSSL RSA keys into Cryptlib keysets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pemtrans file.key file.crt outfile.p15 label secret
.SH DESCRIPTION
.nh
.PP
.B pemtrans
stores an OpenSSL RSA private key and the corresponding signed
certificate into a PKCS #15 keyset for use with Cryptlib.
.PP
Cryptlib stores private keys and the associated public key certificates
in password-protected PKCS #15 keysets. OpenSSL uses a separate pair of
files to store each private key and certificate. Although Cryptlib can
import OpenSSL certificates directly, it does not support the PEM key
storage format, which is undocumented and relies only on the file
permissions to protect the private key.
.PP
This program reads an RSA private key (typically stored in a
.I .key
file) and the corresponding certificate (from a
.I .crt
file), and writes it to a
PKCS #15 keyset. The
.I label
uniquely identifies each key pair within the keyset, and the
.I secret
is used to encrypt the key pair (so that only people who know the secret
can retrieve the key from the keyset).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP file.key
is the PEM-format file in which the private key is stored. It is a
base64-encoded file starting with "---BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY---" or
similar.
.IP file.crt
is the PEM-format file in which the certificate is stored. It is a
base64-encoded file starting with "---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---" or similar.
.IP outfile
is the keyset file to be written. If the file exists, the new key and
certificate will be appended to the file.
.IP label
is the label used to find this specific key in the keyset. The program
that will use the keyset must be configured to use the same label.
.IP secret
is the passphrase used to protect the
.I outfile
keyset. The program that will use the keyset must be configured to use
the same passphrase. This secret is subjected to security checking by
cryptlib, so it must not be too short or too predictable.
.SH EXAMPLE
To generate an OpenSSL private key and self-signed certificate:
.IP
openssl req -x509 -days 365 -newkey rsa: -nodes -keyout host.key -out host.crt
.PP
To generate the
.IR host.p15
keyset from the key created above:
.IP
pemtrans host.key host.crt host.p15 hostname s3kret-p4ssword
.SH KEY USAGE
Cryptlib requires (and respects) the KEYUSAGE attribute on certificates.
Some certificates do not contain this attribute, and pemtrans issues a
warning when it encounters them, because Cryptlib will probably reject
it when you try to use it for something, e.g. in a TLS server.
.PP
OpenSSL, by default, does not set KEYUSAGE. This can be fixed by adding
a line like
.IP
keyUsage = cRLSign, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, keyCertSign
.PP
to
.I openssl.cnf
before generating the key and certificate (the attributes specified here
are enough for the result to be used in a TLS server).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pemtrans
returns 0 in case of success and 1 in case of error.
.SH BUGS
None known.
.SH LICENSE
Use, modification, and distribution of pemtrans is allowed without any
limitations. There is no warranty, express or implied.
.SH INSTALLATION
Just edit the included Makefile, build, and copy the binary and man page
somewhere convenient.
